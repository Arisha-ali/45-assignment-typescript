// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified



function show_magicians(magician:string[]){
    magician.forEach(name => console.log(name)
    );
}


function make_great(magicians:string[]){
    return magicians.map(name =>`the great ${name}`)
}

let magicians_names =["ali","aliyan","ayan"]

let great_magicians = make_great(magicians_names)


show_magicians(great_magicians)
